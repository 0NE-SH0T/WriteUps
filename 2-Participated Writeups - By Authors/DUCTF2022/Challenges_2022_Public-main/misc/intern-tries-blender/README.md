_Yeaaaah mate, listen, we thought it would be cool to give out little 3D printed flags last year, so we had the intern take a crack at blender.. Lemme tell you mate, mistake._

  _So anyway, if you could take what they've done with this blender extension and get us our old flag back that'd be great._

  _It should just be as simple as clicking the generate flag option, the intern keeps mentioning a sidebar but all I can find is a boomerang..._


  Flag Format - DUCTF{FLAG} - No spaces.
