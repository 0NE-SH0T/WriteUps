Examining the  location of all IP's (Using Splunk's |iplocation) you'll notice some activity from a German VPS.

Alternatively while looking through the files you may find this IP's activity suspicious as it bounces around between different urls and doesn't follow the standard browsing "Flow" (Browse > Product > Checkout, etc)

Looking at all the URLs most are clearly scanning for particular files, etc but some of them mention "Nuclei" which upon googling reveals the name of the tool.
