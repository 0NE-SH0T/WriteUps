Pre-Kebab Competition
============

I have a dislike for image OSINT challenges that don't give you enough...in this example you can see that there's a few things that have snuck their way into the photo, namely the neon sign that's not lit and a "Drive Thru" sign with the business hard to decern in the lower right corner. Few ways to go about this, you can idenify that the second word being "cellars" and start looking up Australia cellars to match logos or you might have been able to see that it's "SUPER CELLARS" and start looking up all possible locations and match the clock tower via Google Street View.
	
	At the centre bottom of the image there's a sign that's cut off, but you might be able to see Rawsons, which is the street name.
	
	You might have altered the image to better read the neon sign, which happens to spell out the flag.
