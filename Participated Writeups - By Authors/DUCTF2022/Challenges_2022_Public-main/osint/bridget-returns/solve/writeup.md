# Bridget Returns!
We are provided with the string: download.pausing.counterparts & asked for the name of the bridge where this is located.

This is a what3words coordinate (https://what3words.com/):
** What is what3words? **
We divided the world into 3 metresquares and gave each square aunique combination of three words. Itâ€™s the easiest way to find and share exact locations.

Now what3words comes up with 3 possible locations for this 3 word combo, but through process of elimination we see that only 1 is on a bridge --> located in Clontarf QLD.

We navigate to that location on what3words and get the Flag:
Ted Smout Memorial Bridge
