# Birds Eye View!
We are given a drone shot with the description:
What a nice spot to have a picnic, EXAMINE the image and discover where this was taken.

Instantly attention is drawn to the word EXAMINE as its in capitals, I decided to look at the files EXif data to see if i could gleam any information from that.

There is multiple ways to view exif data but I decided to open up the image in Microsoft Photos.

To view file information(exif data) in Microsoft Photos, press ALT+Enter to bring up the Info Menu.

Upon opening the info pane, I was greeted with a bing maps pane with a description of "Mt Cootha"

Thats a great start but the description of "have a picnic" implied that "Mt Cootha" might not be a detailed enough answer. 
After zooming in on the provided map, the photo was clearly taken at the Hoop Pine picnic area

We end up with the FLAG:
Hoop Pine picnic area
