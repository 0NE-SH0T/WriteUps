  I thought I would try and save some gas by updating my log entries with assembly, I'm not super sure if it's safe, but I have added a password for good measure. 

  But it's okay because if there is a bug I can always upgrade since I'm using the [TransparentUpgradeableProxy](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxy/transparent/TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol) pattern :). 

  I love my creation so much that I add a new log every minute!

  Note the block time on this challenge is 23 seconds, so there will a delay in deploying and resetting the challenge.
  
  Goal: Steal all funds from the contract.
