We are provided with rage.wav, an catchy tune that sounds like it has Morse Code overlaid on it

I personally use Audacity when doing any form of Morse Code related challenge as it allows me to clearly visual any spaces between words.

Technical Details: 500hz 20wpm

We end up with the following Morse Code:
.-. .- --. .. -. --.  - ---  .-- . .. .-. -..  .-.. .. -... .. -.. ---

Upon converting that to plaintext we end up with the FLAG:
